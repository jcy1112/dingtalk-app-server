The motivation of this paper is not clear enough. For example, in the abstract, \"Many key cross-chain technologies ... process of the BitXHub cross-chain platform\", the above three sentences are logically separated, which makes it difficult to understand what problem this research aims to solve and what the research goal is. Similarly, the introduction section has the same issue.\n2. The structure of the introduction section is partially redundant. It is recommended to clarify the contribution of this paper at the end of the introduction section.\n3. From section III to section IV, it seems to only introduce the existing technology, which is hard for a researcher who is not familiar with this topic to get the point.\n4. The title of section IV makes audience feel that this section is still introducing existing technology rather than the model proposed by this paper.\n5. The content of section IV-A is similar to that of section III-C. It is recommended to merge the two sections or try to make them distinct.\n6. There is an issue with the layout of the figures, which leads to a waste of page space.\n7. Clarifications need to be added to make the equations in section IV easy to understand and highlight key points.\n8. The conclusion section and the introduction section are partly duplicated, such as background introduction. Furthermore, this section lacks a true conclusion.\n9. There are some expression issues. For example, on page 10, \"From Figure 10 ... in the image\", the word \"shock\" implies the authors\' subjective emotions. Meanwhile, there is a redundancy between \"From Figure 10\" and \"in the image\", which can be simplified to \"in Figure 10\". On page 11, \"It shows that under the current input state, the entire relay chain system is operating well\", the word \"well\" is ambiguous.\n\nReporter: Shenghui Gu\nMember: Kaiwen Song, Jiarui Wang, Zhiying Li, Bo Pan, Yifan Zhang, Tao Yang, Hao Wang, Jun',14,'2020-10-17 16:34:19',3,_binary '\0'),(16,'## Paper\'s Title\nSynthesizing Qualitative Research in Software Engineering: A Critical Review\n\n## Group Comments\n**Abstract:**\n1)The last sentence in the Method is more like the Conlusion. \n2)The last sentence in the Conclusion is more like the Mehod, it is better to change the way of explanation.\n\n**1.

Authors said \"With the diversity of application scenarios, the complexity of smart contracts is increasing, and the impact of security vulnerabilities is becoming more and more significant\", whilst, the logic is incoherent. We can not conclude that the widely application of block chain and increasing complexity of smart contracts lead to security vulnerabilities becoming more and more significant, which might be the direct motivation of this paper.\n3. Authors siad \"Symbolic Execution, Formal Verification, and Fuzzing are the main techniques of smart contract vulnerability detection\" and then chose fuzzing technology to detect vulnerability of smart constract without any description.\n4.

The article describes the algorithm in detail.\n**Technical correctness of the paper:**\n1) The article lists some challenges, but does not specifically explain how to solve them, nor does it mention how the system improves these challenges.\n2) The article introduces very little data set. If the data set is sensitive, the author can give a picture of the data set, such as listing some statistical indicators.\n3) The author pointed out: Traditional methods, such as regression, random forest and support vector machine, fail to capture continuous time information. But in TABLE5, when the author compared the experimental data of several schemes, he compared it with these self-denying methods.\n4) The author collected many features, and these data are multidimensional. In the experimental comparison part, the author compared with methods that only performed well on single-dimensional time series data.\n5) According to 3) and 4), it can be seen that the effective comparison object of the experiment is only LSTM, which is not enough to prove the effectiveness of the new algorithm proposed by the author.\n6) The paper does not support the title well: Because the purpose of the paper is to improve capacity, prediction is only a method. The experimental results are not sufficiently correlated with capacity, which means that the explanation of how the algorithm affects capacity is insufficient.

This kind of motivation is relatively weak and the starting point is not natural.\n\nIn many parts of the paper, when abbreviations appear for the first time, the readability will be reduced if it is not explained.Such as the sentence “ We built on our and others’ prior work in the field to realize a translation of the kernel’s variability model into propositional logics, to implement a configuration-conflict resolution algorithm relying on SAT solving, and integrate both into the graphical configurator tool xconfig.”\n\nIn the second chapter, the author adds a conclusive description. In this case, we think it is necessary to prove in the first chapter that no similar research has been conducted before, and the first chapter needs to be expanded.\n\nWe have some doubts about the granularity of the summary. We think that if it is common sense knowledge, it is not appropriate to put it in the author\'s own summary.For example, in “Propositional Transformation in C”,we think the sentence “C was not ideal to model propositional logic formulas.” is common sense.\n\nReporter:Dailinzi Ye\nMembers:Xin Huang,Shenghui Gu,Bowen Zheng,Peiyu Hou,Fuli Zhang,Feimei Xie,Zan Gao',1,'2020-12-05 13:34:44',24,_binary ''),(31,'**Group Comments**\nThis paper proposed a novel capacity prediction approach called \'LCSP\' aiming to solve the low efficiency of traditional method to predict when \'the available capacity is exhausted\'.

However, as an article to be published in the field of software engineering, it should have some more general contributions, such as the contribution on software engineering configuration management.\n\nThis article is rather obscure and difficult to understand, mainly because there are too many abbreviations in terms of methods and development tools, and most of them have no relevant explanation.

The idea is to proactively predict resource allocation failures concerning Low Capacity Status (LCS) by leveraging machine learning approaches. A low capacity status is reached when VM  allocation failures escalate to a specific threshold. By jointly considering the data from servers, users, and platform, the proposed approach can make accurate LCS predictions in a complex and dynamic cloud environment, and thereby improve the service availability of cloud systems. The proposed approach is evaluated by real-world datasets collected from Microsoft, and the results confirm its effectiveness.\n\n## Technical correctness of the paper\nThe paper\'s title is \"Effective Capacity Prediction for Cloud Systems\", but in their work, both the data processing and feature engineering are more likely base on the specific data set which from Microsoft. If the authors think this is an experience report, maybe they should modify the title of it. NOT \"Cloud Systems\", \"Microsoft AZure\" maybe appropriate choice.\n\nIn the part of Abstract, the authors just give \"VM\" but don\'t give the full name \"Virtual Machine\".\n\nAlso in the part of Abstract, when talking about the contribution of their work, the paper said: \"The proposed approach is evaluated by real-world datasets collected from Microsoft, and the results confirm its effectiveness.\" In my opinion, a more detail result should be described rather than generic.\n\nSince their work\'s aim is \"Effective Capacity Prediction\", but in the part of Introduction, they may pay more attention to resource allocation failures. So, what\'s the real relationship between them? Maybe there needs some description.\n\nThe paper gives out a special chapter called \"Challenges\", but we can\'t see any solution for those 3 challenges in their paper. Maybe the authors discuss some of it in TTV, but not enough for that chapter.\n\nIn the chapter of \"DATA PROCESSING AND FEATURE ENGINEERING\", which is the core part of this paper, in my opinion, is not described in detail. So, how can other researcher repeat this work? Just refer to the example it gives out?\n\nAlso in this chapter, it said: \"In our experiments, the value of ξ is empirically set to 50.\" So, Why ξ is 50, what\'s the reason？\n\nIn the chapter of \"EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\", the paper lists Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), LSTM as \"Classical Methods\", and writes \" In particular, our model outperforms all classical methods in term of all metrics.\" So, are these 4 kinds of methods can represent all of the Classical Methods？\n\n## How much effort did you spend refereeing this paper? \nReasonable\n\n\n------------------------------------\nReporter: Zijia Jia\nGroup Members: Jun Lv, Changlan Fu, Zhiying Li, Kaiwen Song, Chao Li, Kuilin An.\n',2,'2020-12-06 11:23:51',19,_binary ''),(34,'Title: What Do We Learn from the Migration to Microservice Architecture in Reality? An Industrial Inquiry\nAuthors: Shanshan Li, He Zhang, Cheng Zhang, Zijia Jia, Chenxing Zhong and Zhihao Shan\n\nSummary:\nThis article is an extension version of the conference paper published at ICSA 2019[1], which carries out a series of industrial interviews with practitioners from twenty software companies and aims at investigating the gaps between the ideal visions and real industrial practices on microservices and what expenses microservices bring to industrial practitioners.\nCompared with the conference paper, this article increases sample size from 13 interviewees to 20 interviewees, re-answers the two RQs with some domain-based figures and gives more in-depth discussion on the results. The article is well-structured and clearly presented.\n\nComments:\nAlthough this article is based on a conference paper, it still has the following three major problems: \n1. The article states that it \"re-answers RQs around the domain. Gaps and pains of MSA are analyzed around different domains, which is not considered in the conference paper\". Unfortunately, with the exception of some domain-related figures, the analysis methods used in results section remain largely the same in the conference paper.\n2. The article states that it gives more in-depth discussion on the integrated overview map and the implications to practitioners. However, the discussion section is still limited to the content of the results section, which does not reflect the new content worthy of taking away.\n3. The methodology is not detailed enough, which affects the rationality and correctness of the results.\n\nSome specific problems are as follows:\n1. The \"*\" in Table 1 (Page 3) is not explained.\n2. The research processes in Figure 1 (Page 3) is similar to the one in the conference paper. Is the 3 months of Data Collection accumulated from 2.5 months? The same question is the 1 month of Data Analysis. What role does the publication of conference papers play in this process?\n3. I do not find a list of interview questions in Section 2.3, which are important for readers to understand the results.\n4. \"Six interviews were conducted online due to the geographic restriction\", which six interviews are online? What type of online interview format is used? Van Maanen pointed out that text-based online interviews are not to be trusted[2]. In ethnographic studies, telephone and video online interviews are accepted[3].\n5. What are the details of theme analysis and coding? Are there any criteria for this part of the analysis? Because of the lack of criteria, it seems to me that some of the results are not at the same abstract level, e.g, in Section 4.1, \"the call chains of microservices will become longer and may burden the fault location\" and \"the chaotic independence of microservices may reduce the performance of systems due to the increasing interaction and the long call chain among distributed microservices\".\n6. Are the numbers of employees in Table 2 all the developer/engineer number? How does the size of the company affect interview results? This should be interesting, but it\'s not discussed in the article.\n7. Why the motivations and benefits should be discussed in Section 4.1?\n8. In Section 4.2, \"50% interviewees confirm this characteristic in their practice\", this shows that in the 7 additional interviews, no one commented on this idea. Why? This is worth exploring. Similarly, there may be problems in other sections as well. There may be new findings, but there are concerns about the quality of the additional 7 interviews。\n9. What does the size of the circle represent in Figure 9 (Page 9)? Compared with the conference paper, this figure only added a few tools, but the size of the circle seems the same.\n10. Section 5.1 describes the overview of the map about the results in Section 4. And the 5 decisions are proposed based on the map and results. However, what should practitioners do to complete their transition from monolithic systems to microservice systems in their contexts? This section seems to lack a roadmap or implementation framework.\n\n\n[1] Zhang, He, et al. \"Microservice architecture in reality: An industrial inquiry.\" 2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA).

If it is machine learning, it is better to use the word \"machine learning\", changing to another representation is like a new method.\n2. Abstract: OSS abbreviation does not give the full name, you can change the previous \"open source projects\" to \"open source software (OSS) projects\".\n3. The word is misspelled, change \"maitenance\" to \"maintenance\".\n4. There is no mention of the reasons for doing this work (product tracking and classifier evaluation, etc.), the importance and the benefits of doing this work are not reflected.\n5. This paper does not say why the learning-based method is used, whether there is a rule-based method, a knowledge-base method, the correlation and comparison between them.\n6. \"Many studies have achieved good results by evaluating their traceability recovering approaches on open source projects.\" This sentence can adde the study uses a learning-based classifier, so that it can be better connected to \"This article evaluates learning-based Classifier\".\n7.

The positioning should be clearly stated in the evaluation and experience study, and then describe the method of evaluation and the evaluation results and conclusions.

The experience study work of the same nature as this paper can be separated separately.\n9. Section III Structural Adjustment:\nThe research method can include the research process and the methods used in the process. It is not appropriate to put research questions in the research method. It can be placed in the subsequent evaluation. The evaluation can include the introduction of the data set, the reason for the selection, the research questions, and the experimental design for answering these research questions (it is not clear how to design the experiment here. Answer to RQ), evaluation indicators, etc. Here, in the fourth section of the evaluation, only 4.1 has written indicators. The experimental goals, data collection and experimental results are combined, not very standardized, and the experimental results are not very prominent; 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 The summary can be placed in the result chapter as the research result.\n10. There are two pairs of tracking chains, and the other is a requirement-issue pair. The RQ only talks about issue-commit pair. \n11. The four-fold time series verification is based on the recommendations of which research, whether there is a basis or is it a subjective choice, why the four-fold time series verification is used, and whether it will cause deviations and differences in the results, these need to be considered.\n12.

This supposition comes from the perception that in virtually any research synthesis method, the knowledge extracted from studies suffers an intense transformation. This transformation usually aims at translating individual results in a representation that allows them to be analyzed from the same perspective. Does it mean that the method can only be used under this assumption.\n2. The author gives 5 steps in line 34. There is no way to clearly prove the constituent elements of the method in the implementation of the 5-step method. What are the considerations for the 5-step method?\n3. Section III proposes structured summaries. The author explains that the term \"structured\" is used to refer to theoretical structures, because they are used to express (ie modeling or construction) the results of basic research. Structured summaries are very useful. It is very misleading. The author emphasizes that structured summarization is the core of SSM, but the whole method reads more like a clustering process. It is not clear where the author\'s contribution is. Otherwise, the scaling of Fig2 is problematic.\n4. The data integration method in Section 4 only integrates the current common data integration methods. Through Sections 5 and 6, no clear effect of the SSM method is found.\n5. After reading the article as a whole, it did not clearly explain what SSM is, what are his steps and methods。\n',3,'2021-01-29 10:03:58',61,_binary ''),(55,'The article proposed a method named Structured Synthesis Method (SSM) to solve the challenge of investigating the alternative research synthesis methods for SE. The authors stated that because of the blend of integrative and interpretative features, the method could appropriate to depict the important contextual aspects and to inform the trends of the outcomes (e.g., positive or negative) reported in the studies, as well as a confidence estimation about them.\n\nSome comments are as below:\n\n1. Section Introduction is strange to read. it is more like explaining the background of the research. Moreover, some important articles published in recent years seem to be ignored, such as Huang\'s [1], Fu\'s [2] and Zhang\'s [3]. These concepts are mentioned in the article, but the authors do not seem to pay attention to the latest published literature, which is a bit strange.\n\n2. Section 2.1 is about \"Theories\", I could not see the latest articles about the more famous method \"Ground Theory\" [4]. This part is more like an introduction to the tools used to form a theory.\n\n3. The SSM should foucus on the synthesis of the evidence, why should we consider the selection and some other part of SLR in SSM processes? It does not seem to be particularly helpful for those actions.\n\n4. Section 4.4, it is stated that \"The coding process in SSM does not even need to go through a continuous and iterative process of small steps as it is usually indicated.\" This sentence is somewhat arbitrary.\n\n5. Section 5, how were the two papers selected from the 373 papers? Are there any selection criteria or research biases? Random selection?\n\n6. In the both cases (Section 5 & 6), the evidence synthesis was limited in scope (2 studies in Section 5 and 5 studies in Section 6). When the evidence synthesis was actually conducted for the primary studies, there would be a large number of literatures, and we could not see the SSM\'s support for the synthesis of more literatures. Is there any difficulty in using it while synthesizing much more primary studies.\n\n7. Some values (e.g., belief value in Table 4), the types of the primary study were considered. However, the quality assessment should be considered as well. That would be a fatal blow to the reliability of the integrated evidence.\n\nIn general, the article discusses an important topic in software engineering. However, some structural organization will confuse me. The organization of the introduction to the concept at the beginning of the article is easy to lose the focus.\nEspecially Section Introduction makes me have more expectations for the synthesis of methods and the mix-method approach for SE research. Unfortunately, SSM only focuses on the synthesis of evidence between studies. Although this is important, it doesn\'t meet the expectations the Section Introduction shows to us. Thus, the contributions of SSM in the abstract and Section Introduction could be narrowed down.\n\n\n[1] X. Huang, H. Zhang, X. Zhou, M. Ali Babar and S.

In the background part of the abstract and introduction, it is said that there is still no method for integrating qualitative and quantitative data, the importance of integrating qualitative and quantitative data, or the trouble caused by the integration of the two kinds of data. Some words in the keywords only need to capitalize the first word, and lowercase the following words.\n2. The results part only said that we proposed a structured integration method (SSM) to meet this challenge. It did not say how to propose such a method, how to use this method to integrate qualitative and quantitative data, the corresponding meaning and higher Level of meaning.\n3. The contribution points and the purpose of this work are not listed in the introduction.\n4. The positioning of the contribution points of the article is not very clear. It refers to the method of integrating qualitative and quantitative data, but in fact it proposes a relatively large framework. The steps in the framework are included in existing methods such as SLR and metaethnography. Method, innovation is not clear, work is more inclined to engineering.\n5. The case part is biased towards text description, the demonstration process is not very detailed, the graphics are too few, the use of the process and the benefits are not clear, and the results are not displayed enough.\n6. No related work chapter, can systematically summarize the work related to this work.\n\nIn general, what the article said earlier is to propose a method to integrate qualitative and quantitative data, the content is mixed with some existing methods and proposes a process. There are some inconsistencies, not enough innovation, and not concentrated points. Cases the explanatory part is biased towards text description, insufficient presentation of tools and demonstration of the process, insufficient evaluation of correctness and completeness, unclear enough introduction of the process and benefits, insufficient presentation of results.',3,'2021-01-29 12:26:27',6,_binary ''),(94,'This paper presents a novel method SSM(Structured Synthesis Method) to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data in SE.

The specific comments are as follows:\n\n- In the Introduction, the logic between paragraphs is not clear. There is a large paragraph describing related work, but it does not explain the relationship between this study and related work. Nor does it clearly express the background and motivation of the research.\n\n- It lacks an introduction to the overall methodology of this study. I suggest providing a figure to describe the methodology.\n\n- The experiment appeared very suddenly in Section 3. There is a lack of description of experimental design and implementation. Before introducing what this experiment is and why it is done, the paper begins to introduce the experimental objects. It confused me.\n\n- There is no reasonable explanation for the motivation of the three research questions. Especially for RQ2 and RQ3, as they are not directly related to the research goal described in Section 4.3.\n\n- The Section 5 is about the evaluation results, but a lot of space is used to describe experiments, and the experimental procedures are very difficult to understand. This research seems to have no design and plan at all. The author is constantly deciding what new content will be in the \"further study\".\n\n- There is a lack of description of the imbalance problem. Besides, AUC will fail in imbalance problems.\n\n- The paper attempts to show that time series validation can improve prediction performance. However, model performance is an objective existence. The validation method is a means of observation. Such performance improvement is meaningless.\n\n- The paper does not provide clear conclusions for each RQ, especially for RQ1 and RQ2. The author summarized the results of RQ3. The purpose of RQ3 is factor analysis, but the conclusion is that the learning-based approach can achieve better performance. What is the relationship between this conclusion and factor analysis? And better than what? \n\n- There are no experimental hypothesis in this study.

However, researchers generally followed the SLR guideline for their tertiary studies. This paper does not clearly point out the necessity of a new guideline and what are the specific problems in the existing research that follows the SLR guideline for the tertiary research.\n\n- In Section 3.1, it indicates that the goal of the paper is \"to realize what a TS is and the gap between the current practice and the definition proposed by Kitchenham et al. [30]\". What is this definition? This study did not analyze current practice against the specific definition.\n\n- The paper is vague and contradictory. Take quality assessment as an example. In Section 3.5, the paper indicates that \"most of the tertiary systematic reviews did not report the quality of its included SLRs while quality assessment is recommended in systematic reviews\". However, the rationality of not using quality assessment is explained in Section 5.4. The author also has no clear and specific ideas about what a tertiary study should be. So how can the author provide a critical review? How can the author prove that the existing research is wrong?\n\n- In Section 4.1.2, in addition to basic statistics, no more analysis can be seen for topics. For example, why were so many tertiary studies on GSE published?\nThis is an attractive issue worth discussing.\n\n- The title of Section 4 clearly states that this section discusses RQ1. But the relationship between Section 5 and RQ2 has not been clearly stated. The reason for the division of sections from 5.1 to 5.8 is also confusing.\n\n- The author classified tertiary studies into tertiary mapping studies and tertiary systematic reviews.

For this aim, a systematic literature review on the TSs was conducted, including what topics have been studied in the TSs and how these TSs were conducted. According to the authors, this paper is expected to \"help SE participants to better understand the research status of various areas in SE\".\n\n**Some opportunities for improvement follow:**\n- The motivation in \"INTRODUCTION\" section is not strongly given, by a fact that \"the number of SE researchers focusing on TSs is increasing\" whereas \"there is no systematic reviews on TSs in SE\". The problem behind the fact is not persuasive enough. BTW, the adj \"impossible\" should be used with a second thought.\n- I believe that the vagueness of the definition of \"TSs\" and the distinction between \"tertiary systematic review\" and \"tertiary mapping study\" is one of the most outstanding contribution of this paper. Nevertheless, there exists some points that seem to be contradict with this contribution. First and foremost, from the discussion in Section 5.6, it seems that there are something supposed to be \"the characteristics of a TS\" from the opinion of the authors. Second, given the ambiguous distinction between \"tertiary systematic review\" and \"tertiary mapping study\", how the 38 primary studies included in this paper were classified (into 22 versus 16). \n- The first RQ might be rephrased since the word \"scope\" is too abstract to be understood. Or, more sentences should be given to clarify the rationale behind these RQs. After all, in the current version, I do not see the interpretation of these individual RQs.\n- In Section 3.4, the necessity of each data item is ought to be told, as well as their relationship with the RQs. For example, we do not know what is exactly \"Relationship with relevant TS\".\n- The link between Section 4.1.3 and other part of this paper is somewhat ambitious.\n- The contribution of this paper might be reinforced, e.g. outlining the contribution in the CONCLUSION section.\n\n** Minor details:**\n- Is \"overview\" in the subtitle of Section 4.1 the same as \"scopus\" in RQ1?\n- It is recommended to display RQ2 in the title or subtitle of this paper to align it with RQ1.\n- It would be better to change the title of Section 5.8 to \"TTVs\".\n',26,'2021-02-05 10:36:02',23,_binary '\0'),(136,'This paper aims at investigating to what extent learning-based techniques can be applied to traceability maintenance tasks in a large-scale industrial dataset. For this aim, the authors designed a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of different components configuration of learning-based classifer. They also illustrated the barriers encountered in industry traceability maintenance practice and associated them with the \"performance\" they studied.\n\n**For this paper, some opportunities for improvement are as following:**\n- \"Traceability\" seems to be the most significant concept in this paper; whereas, the concept is poorly defined. It would be nice if more precise definition could be given and highlighted.\n- The \"INTRODUCTION\" section explains that \"traceability maintenance\" (a keyword in this paper), together with \"traceability recovery\" and \"traceability validation\" are \"three main scenarios\" in \"traceability techniques\". Nevertheless, I am aware that the authors use \"traceability maintenance\" and \"traceability recovery\" interchargely in the paper.\n- I believe that the \"problem\" the paper aims at tackling with is too late to be given (too much words are wasted in discussing trifling things).\n- The motivation of this paper is somewhat ambiguous, given that there have already been \"5 studies\" that focus on software traceability in industrial projects.\n- For the \"EXPERIMENT SETUP\" section, I still wonder why the \"two OSS projects\" from Huawei were included.\n- Section 4.3 namely \"Research Questions\" could be put in a more former place rather than in the end of \"EXPERIMENT SETUP\" section. Btw, the precision of these RQs could be improved, as well as \"the goal of this study\". Another recommendation about RQs is to split their \"motivations\" (just below the RQs as I see it) into each RQ to clarify the rationale of each of these RQs.\n- Sincerely, I do think that the relationship between key concepts of this paper (such as barrier, factor, trace links, commit, requirement, issue, etc. ) is hard to be grasp. It is recommended to use a diagram (like class diagram) to illustrate this relationship: the way the paper (SANER-2021-CCF-B-\"Assessing Code Clone Harmfulness: Indicators, Factors, and Counter Measures\": https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-bAMyQnbu6Ao0AowtULl2g) do is an example. Btw, it seems that for this paper a \"BACKGROUND\" section is more imperative than a \"RELATED WORK\".\n- The \"CONCLUSION\" section could be improved to claim contributions harder.\n\n**Miner details:**\n- The \"ABSTRACT\" should be improved: \"learning-based approach can achieve better performance on the industry projects\". Comments: \"better\" than what?\n- I wonder if the \"effectiveness of enhancement\" is the same as \"performance of trace link classification model\".\n- From the gist of the paper, we get that factor analysis is of significance.

In some OSS projects, even if the recommendation system is not used, the commits are reviewed by a small number of developers, and even only a few developers have the right to review.

Title: “by use” -> “by Using”\n\n2. Abstract: The goal of this study is not clear.  In ABSTRACT you mention that this paper aims to present guidelines on how check the quality of GL in SE (SE here without full name is not appropriate). While, I can not well understand the relationship between the goal and the contributions claimed in line 105-112. By the way,  the sentences  here are totally identical to the ones in 1210-1219.\n\n3. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK: This section is too long and makes much effort to introduce some not so important background. This paper mentions that SE researchers have also explored the quality assessment of GL (line 237), however, it does not elaborate the difference between these related work.\n\n4. RESEARCH METHOD: 1) This section misses some essential details to help better explain the whole process. For example, why do you only use the simple data simple technique to extract factors, since it is much more challenging to give a thorough and comprehensive review. How can you ensure the quality of the results and findings through this way?  2) Figure 2 needs to be improved. For example, some terms, e.g., SO, need to be explained; output of the phases “Confirmatory Case study on SO” and “Exploratory survey on QA criteria”  and their relationships are suggested to be added. \n\n5. THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA: 1) Evidence support is not strong in this section. For the explanation of the 24 factors, only four of them have the evidence (references). 2) Section 4.2 requires more analysis. \n\n6. QA INSTRUMENT: The format of Phase 1, 2 and 3 in section 5.1 is different from each other. “The hierarchal structure for the factors challenging DevOps has been developed” in phase is odd. The elaboration in line 1060-1082 in section 5.2 is too short.\n\n7. LIMITATIONS: You only consider three relevant SE conferences in line 1054. How about FSE and other high-quality venues?\n\n8.

The experiments conducted on 20 OSS projects  indicate that the proposed method significantly outperform the state-of-the-art recommenders.  Some comments are here to help you improve the quality of this work:\n\n1. The ABSTRACT needs to be further polished, since it contains many grammatical errors. For example, “appropriate code reviewers is ”, “a lot of attentions”, “A number of reviewer recommendation methods (recommenders) on the basis of heuristic rules, machine learning paradigm are constantly emerging”, “…are short of flexibility, interpretability, accuracy, and more importantly, they…”\n\n2.

The reported result in this paper shows that the proposed method can significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommenders, balancing the trade-off between recommendation accuracy and recommendation coverage.\n\nFor this paper, some opportunities for improvement are as following:\n- The optimization objective of code review is blurred in the paper. First and foremost, the INTRODUCTION part says \"reviewers\' expertise and workload\" are of significance in the quality of code review, then most of previous studies suffer from \"low recommendation accuracy and imbalanced workload\". Besides, is the \"objective function\" of the proposed reviewer recommendation (Section 3.3) aligned with this objective? A focused discussion about this might be given. BTW, there is no detailed explaination about the \"objective function\" in Section 3.3.\n- The motivation of introducing the hypergraph-based method should be imminently refined further. This motivation was just merely illustrated by Figure 1, saying \"hypergraph generally have more capabilities than ordinary graph\" since \"an edge connects exactly two vertices\" in hypergraph. Given that this superiority of hypergraph motivates this paper, I believe more discussions are in need.\n- The authors answered RQ2 (in Section 5.2) by concluding that the proposed method make the trade-off between recommendation accuracy and workload issue, whereas RQ2 only focuses on the \"workload imbalance issue\". This is somewhat awkward. In the meantime, it might be more persuasive to prove the \"better trade-off\" by taking \"accuracy\" and \"workload\" together, e.g., using one figure.\n- The \"key contribution\" of this study (the INTROCUTION part) is driven to distraction, both the sequence of all these contributions and the individual ones, e.g., the introduction of the hypergraph theory might be the foremost contribution of this paper.\n- It is imperative to refine the CONCLUSION part: why this paper is worthwhile is ambiguous in the current one.\n- Also the ABSTRACTION part: what are the characteristics of the proposed method, why is can be used to balance the trade-off?\n- Expressions in the whole paper should be polished: lots of key statements are with insufficient evidence. \n\nIn a nutshell, this study is promising to contribute to the field of code reviewer recommendation.

At present, researchers still have certain concerns and disputes about the use of Grey literature. The focus of the debate is on the quality of GL. This research conducted literature review and survey to study the quality assessment of GL. Quality assessment criteria and a checklist are proposed for assessing GL. The research method is reasonable. However, I still have some concerns about this research.\n\n- As indicated in the introduction, one of the contributions of this study is the identification of major challenges of the use of GL in SE with some possible solutions. However, neither the research question nor the research topic of this paper involves the identification of challenges. In addition, the evaluation of GL and the quality assessment of GL are different concepts.\n\n- The description of the research process (Fig. 2) in the paper is obviously insufficient.\n\n- The experts who participated in the survey and those who participated in the development of the checklist are different groups, but fig. 2 can make readers misunderstand.\n\n- According to the assessment criteria identified in this study, the experience and reputation of GL authors account for a high percentage. This deviates to some extent from the the quality assessment of GL itself. This is a philosophical issue, and such quality assessment may make empirical errors. This is a retrogression of science, bringing research back to the time of Aristotle. In SE, there has been a trend of blind review in academic conferences. The purpose of blind review is to avoid bias. But this research is doing the opposite.\n\n- The FSE requires blind review, but this paper mentions \"our study\" many times.\n\n- It needs to validate/evaluate the checklist. Why is expertise classified as quality of writing? What is the inevitable connection between author\'s expertise and writing quality? \n\n- The assessment criteria are too subjective, it is difficult to avoid bias even if it is quantified.\n\n- The operability of the assessment is poor, and some factors are difficult to measure. For example, it is difficult to have a consistent quantitative standard for the author\'s experience. Everyone has different expertise, and the technology is constantly changing. An expert in traditional architecture does not necessarily understand block-chain better than an expert in emerging technologies.\n\nThere are still many language problems in the writing:\n\n- In Sec. 1, \"This work aim at ...\".\n\n- In Sec. 3.2, \"that could be evaluate GL quality\".\n\n- In Sec. 5.1, \"... their respective categories (Table ??).\"\n\n- In Sec. 5.2, \"... checklist shown in Table 7). \"\n\n\nFrom an academic point of view, considering the lack of time left, I should vote for rejection; but from the perspective of friendship, I finally decided to vote for acceptance.\n\n【PhD】',28,'2021-02-19 12:12:39',37,_binary '\0'),(290,'This article proposed a reviewer recommendation method using hypergraph.Here are some little probelm in this paper:\n1.In INTRODUCTION, it\'s better to give a brife description of structure of the paper.\n2.In EXPERIMENT DESIGN, putting research quetion there is not appropriate.It would be better to put it in a new chapter to illustrate particularly.\n3.There still some grammar mistakes in this paper which you should check it carefully.\n[master]',27,'2021-02-19 12:20:26',14,_binary '\0'),(291,'This paper introduces the entrropy to measure the recommendation coverage and proposes a Hypergraph-based reviewer Recommender(HGRec) to balance the trade-off between recommendation accuracy and recommendation coverage.\n\nSome advantages:\n1.

Authors should state the state of code review recommendation, namely why we should do this recommendation and the challenges of nowadays code review recommendation related research. However,  authors just simply described the phenomenon that \"recommenders suggest reviewers based on historical reviews, which in turn significantly increases their workloads\", which is not convincing enough to believe. Authors should consider list some critical data to illustrate. \n- In Section 3.2, authors described three kinds of relationships in HGRec, while hyperedges are represented with \'two-vertex edges\'. If this statement is true, authors should consider another relationship, namely author-reviewer. What\'s more, I don\'t understand why authors can illustrated one relationship among three factors. Take reviewer-PR-reviewer for example, can this relationship divided into two different relationships? If this answer is True, is factor sequence is another key point in HGRec relationships? I recommend authors should explain this more.\n- According to results, the performance of HGRec is not much better than that of the baseline experiment, no matter Accuracy or Entropy.  Especially we could see recommender CN almost the same performance as HGRec, I think authors should discussed this more to polish your paper.\n- In Section 5.2, authors stated \"In conclusion, recommendation accuracy and coverage balance (entropy) are a pair of conflicting metrics\", but you drew this conclusion only based on your observation from experiments. Because these two variables have no direct relationship from formulation or process. You should stated that this assumption was drawn from your observation by conducting several experiments.\n- The “CONCLUSION” section could also improved to claim contributions harder in order to outstanding from existing work.\n- Although authors listed three metrics to evaluate the performance of different recommenders, however, we can see only two of them were discussed more in this paper, should the second metrics seem unnecessary?\n\n**Miner details:**\n\n- Some error type errors. e.g. \"Acuracy\"\n------------------------------------\n\nMaster Student',27,'2021-02-19 12:44:19',54,_binary '\0'),(298,'This paper use AHP method in assessing the quality of Gray Literature in software engineering.

However, microservices is a software architecture technology that can exist independently, while DevOps is a comprehensive method involving a large number of tools and technologies. Why does this study only discuss DevOps and microservices as well as their relationships?\n\n- DevOps is a concept that is difficult to define, and its boundaries are not clear. How does the author determine that these investigated three companies are adopting DevOps instead of mouthing empty slogans?\n\n- The observation items shown in Table 2 are relatively broad concepts.

The article mentions three results of data analysis in the abstract, which are described as: \"1) Although DevOps has brought huge benefits to rapid delivery, the current adoption of DevOps is fragmentary; 2) the agility and product business need to be weighed for different products; …\". The second point here is prone to misunderstanding. Is it because Devops needs to be weighed when using fragmentation, or does the team need to weigh the entire project?\n2.

It seems that the participant observation is just a preparation for interview in this study. I think there must exist some valuable information that can proof or contradict the description of interviewee, and I recommend to elaborate them.

Two valuable RQs are aimed to be answered by this study using a promising research method.  Here are some comments to help the improvement of this paper: \n\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY: \nIn section 3.2, I was wondering why you conducted interviews in different ways and whether the difference will impact the quality of the findings in this paper. For example,\n1) interviews in one company were combined participant observation, while other two interviews were not. \n2) Since the three companies differ from each other in terms of type, size, products, customers, and even globalization, I do not think it is reasonable to select interviewees whose roles have such great difference among the three companies. \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: \n1）From the results, I can not understand how you answer RQ1 (impacts) and RQ2 (Constraints) proposed in the beginning. “Fragmentary DevOps”, “Abuse of Microservices”, or “Weak Correlation between DevOps and Microservices” all seem to be the state of the practice rather than the impacts or constraints.  Although you try to explain some relevant findings related to the answering of these two RQs in this section, I do not think the arrangement here is logical. \n2）The use of the evidence obtained from the interviews and participant observation is inadequate. The unit of company C* rather than the interviewee I* is mentioned in the whole section.\n3）Disappointedly, apart from the common knowledge that provided by previous studies, few attractive findings can be found from the discussion of this section. \n4）The data requires a more in-depth mining and the visualisation in this section needs a further revision to depict the relationship of DevOps and microservices, their impacts and the constrains.

The impacts of DevOps and microservices on the organizational structure and the adverse effects of the organizational structure on DevOps and microservices are not in the same dimension.  Moreover, to which extend can we verified it is a high impact? \n\n- The relationships between DevOps and Microservices should be illustrated clearly in theory. In Section 2.3,  authors listed the classification of research themes on microservices in DevOps, it seems  DevOps provides an environment while microservices is one of DevOps practices.  Actually, some companies could only adopt microservices architecture while do not stated they adopt DevOps. \n\n- Findings are not novelty.  For example,  it is obviously that obstinate organizational structure could hinder the implementation of DevOps and microservices. However, since authors participated into three different companies with different size, culture and globalization. Is the extend of obstinateness of organization structure in these three companies the same?  If these companies with different structure have the same impact on DevOps and microservices? \n\n- In Section 4, I did not see any content discussed the \"agility and product business need to be weighted for different products\" stated in abstract.  Is this means companies should adopt different extend of DevOps or microservices for different products or something else?

Translating qualitative result into practical guidance can improve the value of the paper.',29,'2021-02-26 13:11:40',31,_binary '\0'),(374,'**[PHD student]**\n\nThis paper aims to discover the impacts of DevOps and microservices on daily work of software team and the impacts of software teams on the adoption and implementation of DevOps and microservices. Claimed to report an ethnographic study, this paper tries to provide a participatory observer\'s perspective on DevOps and microservices.\n\n**For this paper, some major opportunities for improvement are as following:**\n- It is argued that the ethnographoc study contributes to an \"immersive\" understanding of DevOps, microservices in the perspective of software teams. However, what are the imagnied benefits of this \"immersive\" understanding (i.e., motivation) and why this \"immersive\" understanding outforms other research (i.e., evidenced by findings) is not directly from this manuscript. At the same time, another selling point of this paper is that the understanding of DevOps and microservices is obtained from the perspective of software teams. Still, it would be better to put more emphasis on its motivation.\n- The mapping between the results and RQs of this paper is not directly available. Furthermore, it seems to me that the subtitles of the RESULTS AND DISCUSSION cannot cover all aspects discussed within these subsections. For example, the title of section 4.1 namely \"Fragmentary DevOps\" is merely one reason that prevents manefesting all benefits of DevOps. Section 4.1 also discusses the benefits and challenges brought by DevOps, which seemingly were not pertaining to \"Fragmentary DevOps\". Likewise, the title of section 4.2 namely \"Abuse of Microservices\" is merely one root cause of the pains of microservices. It is recommended to rephrase these titles, e.g., \"Impact of DevOps on Software Team\".\n\n**There are still some others issues:**\n- In INTRODUCTION, the motivation of this work is not implicit, by merely saying that existing works \"paid more attention to understandings at the organization level and lacked the immersive thinking from software developers and software teams\". It seems that there are two differences between these existing works and ours: 1) organizational level vs. the level of software developer and software teams; 2) our perspect of thinking is immersive. Whereas, none of these aspects is explicit to readers.\n- For section 2.3, what is the gist of this subsection? Why should we focus on the research themes of current research about microservices in DevOps? Or what are the implications of these themes to this paper?\n- In section 4.1, the relationship between the \"fragmentary DevOps\" and its following part about \"firstly\" and \"secondly\" is hard to grasp. Also, It seems to me that \"software organizations are keen to improve DevOps pipeline\" is not directly linked to its following illustration. More discussions are needed to help understanding.\n- In section 4.2, the explained adoption and implementation of microservices might lead to some distractions, provided that this section is to present the impacts of microservices on software teams (RQ1) and the impacts software teams have on the adoption and implementation of microservices belong to RQ2.\n- To me, the constraints software systems have on the adoption of DevOps and microservices are not feasible in section 4.3. What was illustrated in the begining of section 4.2 might be an option to fill in the blanks.\n- It is somewhat difficult to grasp the gist of what is presented below figure 7.\n- In CONCLUSION, research method should not be the focus of future work, given that this paper focuses on the impact of DevOps and microservices on software team.\n\n**Minor details:**\n- It seems that \"The development of microservices runs or the DevOps pipeline\" in Figure 7 is not aligned with the paper text.\n- \"Three aspects of A, B and C\" is somewhat strange.\n- Does the adj \"real\" express some meaningful information in the title?\n\nTo conclude, I believe that what the paper contributes to the literature, the immersive understanding of DevOps and microservices in the perspective of software teams can be phenomenal. The research methodology is also introduced reasonably, by the way.

In Abstract, Results talks about the results of different training model. However, we think it deviates from the title of this paper and the results of the corpus construction should be discussed here.\n2. It is not necessary to divide the introduction part into three parts because section 1.2 and 1.3 are too short.\n3. The title of this paper refers to blog articles, but the gray literature is discussed in the related work. Therefore, we think the scope is too large.\n4. In the related work, we don\'t see other work about using blog articles to build a corpus.\n5. The title for Section 3 isn\'t appropriate because this section discusses the process of constructing the dataset.\n6. In Section 4, the descriptions of the four traning approaches are not uniform.

This work has certain research significance, but there are still some problems. Some comments are as follows.\n\nComments:\n\n1. Abstract: The abstract was written too concisely, resulting in the background of the research, the research method and the process are not clearly introduced.\n2. Introduction: Here is an introduction to FluentCrypto, which is a wrapper for Node.js encryption API, it relaxes developers from crypto concerns. However, it does not introduce the research process of the work itself, how to propose FluentCrypto, and the methods used. These basic theories can be introduced in the introduction.\n3. Introduction: \"Nevertheless, the work presented in this paper is in its preliminary state and further studies are necessary to claim any generalization.\" The sentence before the organizational structure mentions the shortcomings of this paper, which can be said later, and the contributions of this paper can be listed here.\n4. Section 3: Here is a lot of space to describe this encryption example in detail. The example can be mentioned, but it is mainly necessary to describe the research background and motivation in descriptive language.\n5. Section 5: The experiment setup has no basis, only some steps are mentioned.\n6. Section 5.1 The participants: This method is used by developers who lack cryptography knowledge. The participants should be consistent with the developer’s experience, but here is \"None of the participants expressed that they had either no knowledge or expert knowledge in cryptography.\"\n7. The previous claims are two aspects, one is ease of use, and the other is to reduce misuse to prevent information leakage, but here is only the evaluation of ease of use based on the completion time and difficulty of the task, misuse is not involved, and there is no indicator for correct use.\n8. The difficulty level in the experiment is also subjectively given by the participants. There is no basis for whether there is an average value or how to score it.\n9. Section 6: After the research results are given, the conclusions need to be summarized.\n10. Section 6.3 Final remark: The summary and meaning can be placed in the conclusion chapters. The discussion chapters can be added here, and there is still a lot of space for the article.\n11. There are some formatting issues: There is a space in the middle of \"2 324\" without a comma. Some lists have serial numbers and some have not, some serial numbers are on the outside and some are on the inside, and the format is not uniform. There are uppercase and lowercase problems in some places.\n12.

The introduction states that mainstream developers are prone to misuse of the API and expose sensitive data, but the subsequent experiments do not describe how the tool solves the problem of sensitive data exposure.\n\n2. The data of only 8 people are used as the sample data for the study, which seems a little too small, so it should be considered to increase the number of sample data.\n\n3. How to quantify the difficult values in Table 2, 3, 4, etc., is not clear in this paper, so this data value is hard to convince people.\n\n4. The experiment process is not detailed in this paper. The most important thing is that it does not explain whether the participants have enough time between using the two tools, otherwise the experience of using Node.js native API may affect the time taken to use Fluentcrypto.\n\n5. The conclusion of the article says \"Specifically, it helped developers to deliver secure solutions in a shorter time.\"However, as can be seen from the conclusion of the article, for those who have rich knowledge of information security, Fluentcrypto sometimes takes longer to complete the task. This phenomenon should be explained in the article.\n\n6. Section 4.1 of the article states that this article proposes a DSL, and as an obvious contribution it should be reflected in the abstract, otherwise it will be easy for the reader to think that the contribution is just providing an API.\n\n7. In Section 4.1, \"considering the code example in Listing 6 and the constraints in Listing 3Listing 4Listing 5\", the three listings are written side by side in a strange format.\n',6,'2021-04-02 21:52:11',17,_binary ''),(423,'Title: FluentCrypto: Cryptography in Easy Mode\nSummary:\nThis paper developed a fluent API named FluentCrypto to ease the secure and correct adoption of cryptography in the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment.

It is mentioned in the abstract and Section 3.1 of this paper that 131 items of data in this paper come from retrieval. However, as the data source, the source should be further explained in detail, such as what keywords are used for retrieval and how to exclude data that does not meet the requirements.\n\n2. Since this paper has investigated so many cross-chain projects, it is necessary to use a part of the paper to introduce the advantages and disadvantages of each project, so as to serve as a reference for blockchain developers and make the paper more practical.\n\n3. There are some inconsistency of case in this paper, such as Section 2.5 PoW and PoS, the middle \"o\" should be all lowercase, the same problem exists in Table 2, and the format of WASM and WASM should be the same.\n\n4.

The purpose and motivation of the usage and evolution of the identifier style of this research is not clear.\n2. Abstract: \"Our empirical results achieved some interesting findings. For example---\" The research results and conclusions did not cover all the previous research questions. The two most important points: what kind of impact the use of identifier styles will have on software development, and how the identifier styles will evolve, are not given in the results, especially for the impact of not answering led to the failure to reflect the meaning of this work. \"Our study provided some hints for developers when using specific identifier styles in their identifier-related activities.\" This hints also needs to be linked to the influence of the use of the identifier style, which is related to the necessity and meaning of this hints. The text of the paper does not give this hints.\n3. INTRODUCTION: The first point and the second point of contribution are actually one point, and the two are inclusive (overall and subdivision) relationships. The organization structure of the article is not listed.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: The experimental setting currently only has target items and research questions, and needs to include experimental steps, process, indicators, hypotheses, comparisons, etc. The research question only needs to list the research question, and the steps and evaluation indicators in it should be placed in the experimental design and indicators respectively. RQ3 and RQ5 should be put together, they both talk about evolution.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: In the answer to RQ1, here are five forms that developers follow to define identifiers with this style and their respective proportions. The result report is relatively straightforward, and the analysis process and evidence support are somewhat lacking.\n6. Finding 2: \"camel case style appear to have a higher popularity and a larger code-scale than those projects with the snake case and other styles\". The word \"appear to\" in the second discovery is used here to indicate that the discovery is uncertain, so it cannot be regarded as a discovery.\n7. The scale of figure 5 is different, it should be explained.\n8. Finding 4: On average, the changed identifiers directly involve 6.52% of the source files. This means that a lot of modification operations are required to propagate style changes.\nThe research question is what are the potential impacts of the identifier style change? The answer is too superficial, only that a lot of changes are needed, but it does not actually answer what are the \"potential\" impacts.\n9. Generally speaking, this paper is not an experimental empirical research. It is a bit similar to SLR. The data of SLR is literature, and the execution process of SLR is based on. The data here is projects, and the execution process is not based on strong. A bit subjective and general.\nAfter reading, we didn\'t see what we wanted to see, and we wanted to see the influence of the naming method on the evolution and development speed of the project.\n\nReporter: Changlan Fu\nGroup Members: Bowen Zheng, Dailinzi Ye, Feimei Xie, Zan Gao, Xueshan Gu, Qinglong Meng, Bo Pan, Jiali Chen, Bohan Liu, Shiqi Zhou, Xiudi Chen, Wengang Liu, Leming Zhang',7,'2021-04-09 17:12:37',6,_binary ''),(428,'Title: 区块链跨链技术综述 \nAuthors: Qianwen Xu, Yanze Wang, Shanshan Li\n\nSummary:\nThis paper proposes research and research on cross-chain technology solutions, and analyzes the ideas, characteristics and challenges of the existing blockchain cross-chain technology.

The paper is written from the related work, it is better to write from the background.\n2. In the organization structure of the paper, \"Section 3 introduces the research method and process of this article\" did not see the research problem behind it. The latter is actually written according to the development research status and project comparison, which is different from the previous one. \"The fourth section answers three research questions\" but the fourth section introduces four challenges.\n3. Section 2 Cross-chain mechanism: The application scenarios of each type of cross-chain mechanism are not introduced.\n4. Figure 3: Each icon is not introduced.\n5. Figure 6 is in front of figure 5, figure 5 is not explained.\n6. The line spacing in section 2.5 is a bit large and inconsistent.\n7. Several \"POW\" are inconsistent.\n8. The format of the first paragraph of section 3.1 is different.\n9. Section 4: \"Statistics are shown in Figure 4-1\". However, the figure below the figure is marked as Figure 10. What is written in the paper is \"summarizing the four most critical issues in cross-chain technology\", but what the paper said earlier is the three issues.\n10. References: The format needs to be more compact. According to the format of the Journal of Software, Chinese references should be written in English, and the corresponding Chinese referencesand serial numbers should be listed in the attached Chinese references.\n Generally, the organizational structure needs to be adjusted, the format needs to be standardized, the capitalization needs to be unified, and the typesetting needs to be standardized.\n\nReporter: Changlan Fu\nGroup Members: Bowen Zheng, Dailinzi Ye, Feimei Xie, Zan Gao, Xueshan Gu, Qinglong Meng, Bo Pan, Jiali Chen, Bohan Liu, Shiqi Zhou, Xiudi Chen, Wengang Liu, Leming Zhang',33,'2021-04-09 17:56:31',6,_binary '\0'),(429,'Title：An Empirical Study on the Usage and Evolution of Identifier Styles in Practice\n\nMembers: Haoming Li, Junyu Jia, Juzheng Zhang, Kaiwen Song, Jiarui Wang, Zhiying Li, Peiyu Hou, Shenghui Gu, Jiahui Wang, Zeye Zhan, Xin Huang\n\n In this paper,authors conducted an empirical study on 9,792 GitHub projects to gain some insights into these problems.

It seems reasonable in terms of the content of this paper when you only study DevOps or microservices. From the contents of Section 4.4, you aimed to claim that the correlation between DevOps and microservices in software teams is weak. However, you did not provide adequate evidence to prove that developers thought the correlation is strong.\n- It may not be suitable to provide only one research question. Maybe you can list three questions about the benefits and costs of adopting DevOps & microservices, and how do developers balance between them.\n- Figure 4 need to be described, for example, the meaning of blue lines did not be clarified.\n- The lessons for practitioners seem to be meaningless and unimplementable for practitioners, e.g., the one in Section 4.1.\n- In Section 4.2, the authors just describe the phenomenon of abuse of microservices without digging out the deeper causes of this phenomenon.\n\nGroup members: Shenghui Gu, Runfeng Mao, Xin Yang, Qiming Dai, Bo Pan, Ruihong Liu',37,'2021-05-01 21:55:26',3,_binary '\0'),(448,'Title: Identifying and Detecting Architectural Smells in Microservices: An Industrial Experience Report\n\nThis paper presents the experience of adopting and adapting prior approaches to identify and detect architectural smells in one large-scale microservices system of the authors\' collaborators, with the aims of supporting microservices architecture improvement.

However, the practitioners may not benefit from the former experience. The identified architectural smell list is enough and the developers may not care about the process of identification that is not an industrial experience. Therefore, the title \"An Industrial Experience\" is not suitable for this report.\n- Several challenges are reported both in the process of the identification and the detection of architectural smells.

It seems that the paper does not explain the correlation between the two and how they are combined together to reach this conclusion.\n4、The fifth section says that this experience is not applicable to other scenes, but only to similar cultural scenes.

The introduction of DDD in the introduction part is not sufficient, and it does not reflect the importance of DDD in software design. In addition, in the introduction part, some challenges of applying DDD proposed by researchers need to be discussed to illustrate the importance of this paper.\n2. RQ\'s motivation is not clear enough. Some evidence is needed to prove the necessity and effectiveness of them. For example, the need to discuss benefits is not explained and why challenges and solution need to be discussed.\n3. Fig1 shows both the action and the entity, which is a bit confusing. Does the product consider arrow + number instead.\n4. The benefits and measures mentioned in the paper do not give the number of papers, that is, what many researchers believe are the benefits of applying DDD and the measures to solve the challenges. The direct listing of results is less instructive for researchers.\n5. Benefits, challenges and solution are separate, and they are not connected in this paper. I feel that the whole RQ proposal is fragmented.\n6. In this paper, the pattern is an important part, but it is not mentioned in RQ.\n7. The eleven in the abstract should be Roman numerals.\n8. The comparison with Evans in Figure 7 is confusing, whether other forms of presentation are considered, such as curves instead of lines.\n9.

How to apply DDD is a very important and valuable RQ. It is not enough to answer this question mainly by pattern. There is no explanation on how some steps mentioned in the answer were obtained. \n11.

Why this enterprise revived Fagan inspection?\n2. What features does new inspection learnt from Fagan inspection?\n3. What is the difference between new inspection and modern inspection? Although Table 1 illustrates some differences, I expect more details about it, especially the content under specific context.\n\n**Major concerns**\n1. Fagan Inspection is a traditional method for code review, although few organize use it nowadays, many code review processes are affected by it.

I can understand the modern code review is not satisfactory in some enterprise, but the authors need to elaborate the context to explain why the existing methods cannot solve your problems and how can Fagan Inspection work.\n2. As a quarterly program, new inspection seems totally irrelevant with modern inspection (daily), because the enterprise can use both of them while developing. Since the stage of new inspection is post-test, I would recommend to compare it with version acceptance.\n3. The experience seems too normal and without novelty.

I recommend to rewrite the ABATRACT because the current version focus on evaluate the engineers automatically.

In the middle of the introduction of the paper, the authors describe how AI has progressed over the last decade by saying, \"The last decade have seen rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications.\" I suggest this section be changed to explain how AI approaches can be applied to security research. Accordingly, this sentence can change to \"The last decade have seen the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in security research\". Then, the following explanation can concentrate more on specific AI approaches used in security research, opposed to the normative AI approaches.\n\n5. The paper claims that \"There is currently a lack of systematic understanding of the use of AI in security needs.\", but I think more citations are needed to support the claim.\n\n6.

The motivations highlighted both in the abstract and in the introduction do not convince me. The research gap here, according to the authors, is that the current frameworks in this field are in “a high level of abstraction”, which could be bridged by “detailed information to support the application of frameworks”. However, I can not see, why these “information” from this SMS can support the application of such abstract frameworks. The authors might provide some concrete examples to  support these opinions. \n2. Even though these frameworks act as the background and motivation of this paper, we do not find enough discussions about the current drawbacks of these frameworks in Section 2. It seems that these discussions are incorporated into Section 3, with a meta-model of V&V process, which is not reasonable for me.\n3. The derivation of the meta-model in Figure 2 is not rigorous, neither the meta-model itself. For the derivation of the meta-model, the authors might find the related work from domain-specific language helpful. For the meta-model itself, I suggest to use the standard annotations from UML to represent the meta-model. Btw, the naming of this meta-model is not appropriate enough, for example, in the\nterm “goals of quality aspects”, “quality aspects” seems to be redundant, as there is already a term “quality aspects”.\n4.

I recommend to briefly introduce the logic of RQs to match your “Method” with “Objective”, and highlight your contribution about why this study can help modelers to improve their V&V process.\n\n**INTRODUCTION:** Although the difference between this version and ICSSP 2017 has been given in this section, the reason of these changes is unclear. I recommend to elaborate how V&V of SPSMs change in recent five years and why an updated and extended version is necessary for this domain.\n\n**METHODOLOGY:** The mapping between the results of RQ1-3 is valuable, however, it will be better to move it to DISUCSSION section rather than add a new RQ for it. In somewhere, I suppose that the mapping of quality aspects, goals and methods is naturally part of the answer to RQ3.\n\n**FINDINGS:** The visualization of research result is legible and I really appreciate it.

The research topic of this paper is \"Security Requirements\", which may be unfamiliar to some people, so I think it\'s better to give an overall introduction of it with some SR examples in Section 2.1. And the readers can better understand the situations where the AI methods are used and how they are used.\n2.

As for the research questions, I think the current phrases of these questions are far more general than what are actually answered. For example, in RQ1, answering the question of “how to deal with security requirements with AI’’ by presenting only the AI technologies used to deal with security requirements and the security requirements issues dealt by the AI technologies can be disappointed for readers.\n4.

However, there exists several issues in the current manuscript that can be taken into considerations in the following revisions.\n- The title \"Research on Model-driven Development Techniques for Blockchain-based Systems\", is too general to describe both the content and the contribution of this paper. In my point of view, it is more likely to be a title of a secondary study, rather than a primary study.\n- The motivation of this paper is far from clear. First, the authors argued that \"it is difficult for researchers to form a consistent understanding of the status quo, limitations, and research opportunities in model- driven blockchain development\". However, why is the lack of \"a consistent understanding\" and why such a understanding is significant for the community is unknown. The authors have to make a clear claim. Second, the authors claimed that \"most studies currently only support Ethereum [8], the advantages of model-driven development that supports multi-objective frameworks have not been well utilized.\" However, what are the interrelations between Ethereum and the multi-objective frameworks?\n- Due to the ambiguous motivations, I can not figure out why there is a need for the systematic literature review on model- driven blockchain development. More importantly, the relationships between this review and the proposed approach is not clear to me. I don\'t think that a systematic review is required to motivate the following approach. A more specific questions is about RQs of the review and the approach. For example, given that RQ3 is to investigate the challenges of MDD for blockchain SDLC, I cannot understand why the MDD techniques can be applied to solve the found challenge, as claimed in section 4.2.2.\n- The research niche of the proposed model- driven approach for the blockchain software development lifecycle is not underlined, at least in the Introduction section. In Section 4.2, the authors highlighted that \"there is still no method or tool to support the development of blockchain-based systems based on model-driven systems of different phases and for multiple platforms\". However, why there is a need to cover the different phases of the development of blockchain-based systems? And what are the difficulties of designing such a method or tool?\n- The paper structure that combines results of the literature review and the proposed approach is somewhat odd to me.\n- It seems that the proposed approach aims to address all the observed challenges, from challenge 1 to 10. If so, that could be a quite significant contribution for this approach. However, I doubt that whether there exists some overclaims here. For example, C3 is about that \"the smart contract implementations of design patterns are still written manually\". Then, whether the Pattern2Logic meta-model and the model transformation based on it is enough to address C3 and how? The authors have to provide more specific details and make more careful statements here.\n- For the case study, a more quantitative evaluation with solid study design and rigurous measurment is required, especially for the \"correctness of codes generated\". For example, some automated testing frameworks can be leveraged to check whether the transformed models are correct as expected.',96,'2022-05-14 16:09:16',23,_binary '\0'),(1112,'This paper proposes a cloudification framework for blockchain based on hyperledger fabric and instantiates the framework with a kubernetes operator prototype tool. However, it confused me with several questions when I read the current manuscript.\n- For the motivation, given that BaaS is a cloud service platform, I do not understand why it is weak in empowering the blockchain with cloud capabilities. Specifically, the authors highlighted that the blockchain services are more complex than regular cloud services without further explainations about the reasons and the possible effects. Furthermore, the first challenge claimed in the Introduction, \"the basic commercial application tools of blockchain are not perfect\", is too general and seems to be a kind of overclaim, as your intention in this paper is not to fix the current \"unperfert\" commericial tools.\n- The authors argued that \"the proposed framework\" is \"based on\" Hyperledger Fabric, and it can \"make full use of the characteristics of the cloud to improve the portability, reliability, usability, scalability, and security of Hyperledger Fabric\". My question is that given that the Hyperledger Fabric is a mean in this paper for cloudification, why it is significant to improve the quality of Hyperledger Fabric. Shouldn\'t our focus be on how well the Hyperledger Fabric can solve the challenges we face? After reading the whole manuscript, I realized that the framework is not proposed based on but oriented to Hyperledger Fabric. I suggest the authors using more specific statements here.\n- For addressing the challenges that \"the BaaS platform is weak in using cloud capabilities to empower the blockchain infrastructure\", I wonder why a quick review about Kubernetes is required. I mean, the interrelations between the challenge and Kubernetes are not stated. A further question is that whether the review about Kubernetes is enough to provide required knowledge for addressing the challenge.\n- For the \"RAPID REVIEW\" section, what are the role of the \"Blockchain Cloudification Design Principles\" in this paper? Which resources of evidence from the data extraction contribute to these principles? Is there any relationship between them to the \"principles\" in section 3.3.\n- For the \"BLOCKCHAIN CLOUDIFICATION FRAMEWORK\" section, the framework proposed in figure 3 is disordered, which is inconsistent with what are described in section 4.1 and should be refined. Similar problems exist in figure 4, where some appropriate legends should be provided to indicate the activities and artifacts in the process. Second, there is no formalized descriptions in table 4 for each attribute, which could impede the application of the framework. Given that \"Hyperledger Fabric has a set of standardized data structures and interfaces\", I wonder if it is possible to give more formal descriptions of these attributes. Third, section 4.1.2 is unstructured and hard to follow. Fourth, for me section 4.1.3 is more like an background introduction of Hyperledger Fabric networks deployed in the Kubernetes, rather than part of a proposed framework.

There are several comments that might be taken into considerations by the authors in subsequent revisions.\n- What is claimed in the abstract, \"an output assessment approach\", is at odd with the highlighted \"industry practice\" in the paper title.\n- In the introduction, the underlined TOPSIS and iForest approaches are somewhat strange to me. I mean that firstly, the authors do not explain what are cross-comparison and self-comparison. Second, what are the roles of these two approaches in the comparisions are not explained.\n- Still in the introduction, the evaluation results from a half year are described in a qualitative way, which is not persuasive enough. I wonder whether it is possible for the authors to complement the results with more quantitative and rigurous evidence.\n- The first contribution is inexplicable for me. I mean in which section/subsection the \"real-world empirical practice\" is stated. Furthermore, I don\'t agree that a \"real-world empirical practice\" in industry can be significant to the SE community.\n- In section 3, I think that the authors mixed the data collection process for proposing the assessment approach and that for measuring the metrics about engineers\' activity, accoring to figure 3 and 3.1 subsection. Specifically, given that the metrics collection is one of the major steps in the proposed approach, the \"data source\", \"data collection\", and \"data analysis\" which are the research activities for proposing the approach should not be included in the Metrics Collection section. Cause it might bring the ambiguity whether these activities should be included in the assessment approach. More importantly, as the foundation of the assessment approach, the rationale underlying collected metrics should be explained further.\n- For section 3.2, why the TOPSIS and iForest approaches were adopted is not well-explained. \n- Still for section 3.2, the authors argued that \"the standard TOPSIS method attempts to choose alternatives that simultaneously have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution\". However, in this approach, what are the specific meanings of the retults? That is, which kinds of two developers can be derived by using this approach is not explained. Furthermore, are the derived developers alined with the intentions of the \"cross -comparison\", which aims to explore the differences in work output between team members.\n- Still for section 3.2, given that the iForest approach was proposed in prior study, I doubt the real contributions of the approach in terms of self-comparison.

Main contents and contributions:\nDDD utilizes a set of standard patterns in models and implementations, however, implementations may deviate from domain models and patterns. This paper mainly proposes methods to check the schema consistency of domain models.\nThe main method is to assume some schema-related concepts and constraints, implement them in the model and code using a specific language, then extract the implemented model backwards from the code, and verify whether the schema conforms to the predefined rules by comparing the conceptual model and its implementation. \n\n3. Advantages of this paper\n	Pay attention to the consistency of DDD\n	Extend UML and Java with a new language that formally defines schema-related concepts in models and defines schema-related concepts in code that follows predefined conformance rules.\n	Statically extract information from actual source code to build an implementation knowledge base. Based on the knowledge base, a mapping model between the target domain model and the implementation is established to further clarify the differences and missing relationships between them.\n	To collect results from the implementation, use the Java reflection mechanism to review the software and store the collected data in the implementation knowledge base.\n\n4. Disadvantages of this article\nThe versatility of the implementation method is relatively limited, it would be better if it could be implemented on other language.\nPage 8, All the results, either manual and automatic ones, were then compared and discussed by researchers to find any difference (see Table).
